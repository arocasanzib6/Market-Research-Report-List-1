<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Research Laboratory Centrifuge Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical</li><li>Horizontal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The research laboratory centrifuge market comprises two main types: vertical and horizontal centrifuges. Vertical centrifuges feature a fixed-angle rotor, allowing samples to separate efficiently under gravitational force, ideal for quick sedimentation of particles. Conversely, horizontal centrifuges use a swinging bucket design, enabling samples to rotate outwards for better separation of lighter components. Both types cater to specific applications in biochemistry, molecular biology, and clinical research, providing flexibility and efficiency in laboratory operations.</p></p>
